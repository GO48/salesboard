# Salesboard

My scrimba bootcamp solo project in module 3. 

I build it from scratch and use all the tricks and great practice I learned so far.

I also learned from building:
- how to organize the css and make it dry!
- how to toogle dark/light theme by learning from [The Ultimate Theme Toggle](https://dev.to/whitep4nth3r/the-best-lightdark-mode-theme-toggle-in-javascript-368f)
